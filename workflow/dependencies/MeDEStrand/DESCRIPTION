Description: MeDEStrand was developped to infer absolute methylation levels from enrichment-based methylation profiling data that includes MeDIP-seq, MethylCap-seq/MBD-seq etc. MeDEStrand acquires its strength by utilizing a sigmoid model to estimate and correct CpG bias, as well as utilizing asymmetric bin counts from reads mapped to positive and negative DNA strand to further improve the accuracy.License: GPL (>=2)
